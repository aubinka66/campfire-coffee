Wednesday requirements I finished up today. Wednesday Jan 20 2016.

As a business owner, I want the business-side of my site to provide me with accurate sales projections so that I can manage staffing.

As a developer, I want be sure that the public-facing page contains all information that customers would typically seek at a business's website (addresses, hours, contact information, etc.).

As a customer, I want to know if the business recommends any specific use procedures for their products.
